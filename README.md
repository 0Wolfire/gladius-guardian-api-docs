# Gladius Guardian API Docs
### Building our docs
You'll need ruby and bundle `gem install bundle`, or use vagrant
```shell
# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
vagrant up
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!
