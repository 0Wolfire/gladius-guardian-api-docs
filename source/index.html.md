# Introduction

Welcome to the Gladius Guardian documentation! Here you'll find information on
how to run the various Gladius services, as well as get their stats and logs all
 from a nice `REST` interface,

We have language bindings in Shell, JavaScript, and Go! You can view code
examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming
language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
